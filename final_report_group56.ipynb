    "Given our combined interest in financial crime and security, we had chosen a credit card transaction dataset with over a million entries. Initially we were excited to independently explore how variables associated with credit card usage impact the authenticity of a transaction however as we dived deeper into the variability of our dataset, our project scope focused on finding if there exists a relationship between each of the variables available to us and if one could make effective and consistent prediction regarding the occurence of credit card fraud. Our individual focuses were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How can one ascertain a fraudulent transaction which used a pin number or a chip by analysing the distance from the previous transaction, the ratio of the purchase price to the median price, and whether the transaction was made at a recurring retailer?\n",
    "- How does the distance from home affect the likelihood of credit card fraud in both online and offline transactions?\n",
    "- What relation does the distance from home and distance from last transaction attribute have when a transaction is made using CHIP. How does that affect the likelihood of the transaction being considered as fraudulent?"

    "#### We began by working with an extensive dataset, which included a million datapoints. To simplify the data, we narrowed down our focus on several variables, such as distance from home, last transaction, and ratio to median purchase price. Subsequently, we delved deeper into exploratory data analysis using fundamental techniques like .describe, .info, and .corr. However, despite our efforts, we were unable to extract any clear correlations or obtain substantial insights by reducing the dataset. Hence, we opted to use the groupby function, with each member of our team focusing on a specific variable to examine, which ultimately provided us with a much more comprehensive understanding of our data. Each of us also have opted to subset our dataset to to focus on a specific distribution of our data to be able to simpify our analysis. We have consolidated various illustrative plots, including violinplots, barplots, heatmaps, and scatterplots to explore and answer our individual resaerch questions. ####"

    "**As part of the analysis that focuses on transactions that have either used chips or pin number to authenticate, this stacked barplot aims to explore if there exists a significant relationship between the distribution of each veritification type with fraudulent transactions. For all transactions using pin number, there is a relatively steady distribution of fraudulent and authentic transactions that have used pin numbers. The same cannot be observed in the plot comparing fraudulent transactions with chip usage. It is clear that with more fraudulent transactions, there is a higher usage of chips than pins at close to 90% of the transactions using chips.**"

    "#### Using this boxplot we can analyze quite a few things! First would be that we can see off the bat that the chances of a transation being a fraud when it offline is very minimal but when it's online there is a much greater chance of it being a fraud. Now going a bit into details of the boxplot we can see that when the distance from home is less than 100 and it being online then the chances of a fraud is much higher. This graph is a very useful graph that will help us get close to answering our reserach question. That is because we see that frauds mainlt occur when the the payment was made online and when the dustance of the transaction. is less than 100. ####"

In general, all fraudulent transactions, disregarding the use of chip, fall in a very similar range for distance from last transaction. The use of chip however does very slightly increase the possibility of fraud in a transaction. As we can see from the plot, transactions that used chip have a slightly greater range for distance from last transaction. However, as per the deeper analysis conducted on this attribute, we can establish that there isn't a very strong correlation between this attribute (distance from last transaction) and fraud."
