## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
With our respective career and extracurricular interests in data/computer science. more specifically fintech, we realised we have a combined interest in identifying demographic wide issues related to cybersecurity and financial crime. With the advent of seamless transactions, the development of RFID may have propelled the fin-tech avenue for transactions, but it has also opened a gateway to a host of financial crimes. Our interest lies in questioning if one could make an educated and relatively informed prediction regarding the occurrence of a credit card fraud, where each of us would like to explore the relationship between each specific element related to a transaction and fraud. Ultimately, question if these inferences can be used to avoid the frequent, yet avoidable choices made by individuals in a transaction. In order to make the most of this information, we will conduct a thorough analysis of the data, including both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques. Our goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of credit card fraud, and perform root-cause analysis to develop more effective strategies for detecting and preventing it. From the informative and rich analysis of this dataset, we hope to contribute to an individual consumer's wealth security and wellbeing. With the current variables in the dataset, our group can visualise a dashboard with clear graphical representation of relationship between each of these variables and the occurrence of credit card frauds.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

{Sourced from Kaggle, and owned by Dhanush Narayanan R, the carefully selected dataset lists various aspects of 5 million credit card transactions and if each was reported as a fraudulent transaction. These aspects include variables such as distance from home, distance from last transaction, ratio to median purchase price, if the transaction site was a repeat retailer, if a chip was used, if a pin was used to verify transaction and if it was an online order.
These variables have been chosen based on unconventional aspects of a credit card transaction to find the existence of a possible relationship to on-site financial fraud. Even though the original publication does not specify the date/year of data collection, the recent update to the dataset was performed in 2014, upholding its temporal validity to be representative of current fin-tech issues.}
