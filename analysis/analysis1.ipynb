    "#### (ADAPTED) How can one ascertain a fraudulent transaction which used a pin number or a chip by analysing the distance from the previous transaction, the ratio of the purchase price to the median price, and whether the transaction was made at a recurring retailer?\n",
    "#### (ORIGINAL) Is it possible to determine the legitimacy of a transaction by analysing the inter-relationship between the distance from the last point of transaction, the ratio to median purchase price and if the transaction was made at a repeat retailer?\n",

    "##### How is fraudulent transaction defined in the dataset?\n",

    "**Rationale**\n",
    "###### I have an interest in data privacy and areas of breaches, and with the limited statistical and python knowledge I believe this credit card fraud analysis allows me to gain the basic technical knowledge needed to further understand the techniques involved in further complex data analysis. Following the factors associated with a credit card transaction, I would like to understand if a trend exists between the distance from last location of transaction with the same credit card and a fraudulent transaction. Given the complexity of real life scenarios, I am also interested to know if higher median transaction suggests a greater chance of fraudulent transaction going through. In addition to which, if the point of transaction being a repeat retailer suggest a specific spending pattern that can contribute to higher chances of fraudulent transactions going through."

The likelihood of an online purchase being fraudulent is higher than when made at a POS. At -0.016, there exists no relationship between repeat retailer and fraud. Although one could say, the smallest of correlation that exists points to a negative relationship where one can say that among the points that seem to be linearly related, if the retailer was recurring, the chances of fraud was lower than when new. Otherwise, there seems to be no prominent correlations between any of the variables, with most of the correlation variables ranging closer to 0.

    "**Each of the variables were usre used to compare against the distance from last transaction to confirm the analysis conclusion that was made earlier. For the ranged subset, there seems to be no correlation or causal behaviour when distance from last transaction changes. All the same for chip and pin usage with distance to median purchase price. However, there is a sharp increase in the ratio to median purchase price from 2.5 to 17.5 when distance is between 278 annd 333 (km) and immediately drop to near 0. This demonstrates an unpredictability of behaviour and hence no correlation between thw two variables. However, a prominnent linear trend that is observed is the relationship between tthe ratio to median purchase price and distance from last transaction. Relative to all other observations, one can confidently conclude that with incremental increase in distance from last transacion as ratio to median increases, there is a positive linear trend.**"

    "**Compared to the heatmap prior, this range data take into consideration a smaller subset which makes it easier to infer details from. Before drawing any conclusions it must be understood that only variables of the same type can be used to compare one another. Hence, after the strongest correlation of -0.84 between used chips (categorical) and distance from home (continuous variable), there is a pearson's correlation of -0.64 between fraud and used chip. This negative relationship demonstrates that with increasing usage of chips, the likelihood of fraud decreases and vice versa. Compared to 0.095 considered an insignificant correlation when comparing the two variables earlier in the original dataset, this is contradictory. However, this behaviour can be explained by the distribution of data points and one can conclude tha the limitations of this dataset does not allow us to cnofidently infer any predictable behaviour between the variables. However, one can say that in the case of this dataset, with a smaller subset of the dataset our confidence in our inferences could increase.**"
